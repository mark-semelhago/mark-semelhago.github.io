## Mark Semelhago

My name is Mark Semelhago and I am currently a Research Scientist in the Supply Chains Optimization Technologies (SCOT) organization at Amazon in New York. I graduated with a PhD in Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences in 2020 from Northwestern University where I was fortunate to be advised by Professors Barry L. Nelson, Andreas W&#228;chter and Eunhye Song. The title of my dissertation was "Computational Aspects of Discrete Optimization via Simulation with Gaussian Markov Random Fields." This resulted in the production of GMIA/rGMIA code, the repository for which can be found <a href="https://github.com/mark-semelhago/GMIA_rGMIA">here</a>.

Prior to this, I graduated with a BASc in Engineering Science in 2015 from the University of Toronto where I was lucky to be advised by Professor Roy Kwon.
